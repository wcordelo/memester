We offer the Site, including all information, tools, and services available from the Site (collectively, the “Services”) to allow you to interact with memester - a web application that allows users to edit content and mint images, conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies, and notices set in this Agreement.

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using the Site. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you should not access the Site or use the Services; however, by accessing the Site or using the Services, you consent to the Agreement.

Any new features or tools which are added to the Site shall also be subject to the Terms. You can review the most current version of the Terms at any time by visiting this page. We reserve the right to update, change, or replace any part of these Terms by posting updates and/or changes to our Site. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for changes.

EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTES RELATING TO THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

## 2. General Conditions

To access the Site and use the Services, you must be at least 13 years old. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet the eligibility requirement. If you do not meet the requirement, you must not access or use the Site or the Services.

You may not use our Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Services, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

We reserve the right to refuse the Services to anyone for any reason and at any time.

The Site and Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our sole discretion. We may temporarily or permanently suspend our provision of the Services or any features within the Services to users at any time.

## 3. Services

**The Site allows you to edit content, upload, and store images, which can be shared on third party applications such as Lenster or Phaver.**

The Site is provided to allow you to edit content and mint images through memester. These images or “memes” can be shared on on third party applications such as Lenster or Phaver once minted. We reserve the right - but are not obligated to - limit the provision of Services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to limit the type and number of memes that can be minted via this Site. We reserve the right to discontinue the Services at any time. Lenster and Phaver are a third party websites that we do not control.

**You are responsible for securing your digital wallet.**

You connect to and interact with the Site and Services through your personal digital wallet. You are responsible for safeguarding your digital wallet. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to secure your wallet or damage resulting from connecting your wallet to the Site. You alone are responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access to your private keys.

**Entries on the blockchain are not anonymous.**

A widespread belief is that entries and transactions involving blockchains are anonymous. In fact, a central feature of blockchains and thus, blockchain-based transactions and entries, is that they are transparent. Your public key and your wallet address, which you need to interact with the Site, are visible to anyone. To the extent your public key or wallet address can be linked back to you, it would be possible for someone to determine your identity.

All transactions and blockchain entries accessed through the Services are irreversible, final, and without refunds.

**Any content uploaded to our Site will be hosted by IPFS, a third-party hosting service.**

You understand and agree that files uploaded to the Site are hosted on the Interplanetary File System (“IPFS”), a third-party hosting service. We do not control and are not responsible for any act or omission by IPFS as it pertains to the user interface or otherwise. The use and access of any third-party products or services, including through the Services, is at your own risk. By using our Site, you consent to any content that you have uploaded being hosted on IPFS. Any content that is reported and subsequently removed from the Site will continue to remain stored as a file on IPFS.

**You assume the risks of engaging in transactions that rely on smart contracts and other experimental technology.**

Transactions on the Site rely on smart contracts stored on a blockchain, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of tokens, cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to interact with the Site. We assume no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology.
One of the other defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. Similarly, smart contracts, which are programs stored on a blockchain, are also immutable and cannot be deleted or modified.

THUS, TRANSACTIONS RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN MUST BE TREATED AS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE BY US OR BY ANYONE. **YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU FINALIZE ANY ENTRY OR TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.**

**You acknowledge the risks of using the Services.**

You bear sole responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all transactions and blockchain entries accessed through the Services are irreversible, final, and without refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted or adversely impacted as a result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses, and/or other operational or technical challenges, among other things. We disclaim any ongoing obligation to notify you of all of the potential risks of using and accessing our Services. You agree to (defined below) accept these risks and agree that you will not seek to hold any memester Party responsible for any consequent losses.

**The Site is deployed on blockchain-based networks, and we are not responsible for the operation of such networks.** 

The underlying blockchain networks on which the Site is deployed, including the Polygon Network, is open source, which means that anyone can use, utilize, and build on top of it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that (i) we are not responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Site, (ii) there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (iii) the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may impact parts of or your use of the Services.

**The Services are provided free of charge, however, there may be associated blockchain fees.**

By using the Services, you understand that it is being provided to you as a giveaway good, free of charge (i.e., no consideration in the form of monetary or non-monetary compensation). However, transactions using blockchains require the payment of “gas fees,” which are fees paid on every transaction that occurs on the selected blockchain network. We may, at our sole discretion, cover the gas fees for users. We may temporarily suspend or permanently stop covering the gas fees at any time. We do not receive any fees for any transactions, the Services, or the Site.

## 4. Accuracy, Completeness and Timeliness of Information

We are not responsible if information made available on this Site is inaccurate, incomplete, or not current. The material on this Site is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon. Any reliance on the material contained on this Site is at your own risk.

This Site may contain certain historical information. Historical information is not necessarily current and is provided for your reference only. We reserve the right to modify the contents of this Site at any time; however, we do not have any obligation to update the information on the Site. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor changes to the Site.

## 5. IP Rights and Ownership

Content creators and owners retain their existing rights to any content uploaded, edited, or minted into an image utilizing a smart contract on the Site in connection with the Services. However, by using the Services, all users (including content creators and owners) grant limited licenses to one another to use their contributions in various ways, as discussed below.

By using the Services to mint an image, users receive, for so long as they own the image, a limited, worldwide, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable, license to use the image to: (i) publicly and privately display the image at any size; and (ii) to market, promote, advertise, and sell the image. This license belongs only to the then current owner of the image and automatically terminates when they no longer own the image. An image owner may expand the rights granted to image owners as part of a particular sale, in which case those rights will also be attached to the image purchased.

Image owners may only use, sell, trade, transfer, copy, or display the content associated with a minted image for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the artwork (“Commercial Use”) subject to any applicable Terms of Use. Examples of Commercial Use include creating and selling copies of an image, licensing the image for commercial purposes (e.g., selling merchandise, products, or services), or otherwise commercially exploiting the image.

As a user, you represent and warrant that you hold all rights, licenses, authorizations, and power necessary to grant the rights held under the particular terms governing any content that you mint into an image through the Services. You agree that any such content will not violate the copyright, trademark, right of publicity (e.g., image, likeness, persona, performance, signature, voice or other indicia), or other proprietary rights of any third party. Any minted image that incorporates the works or personas of others must have been minted with the necessary permission, constitute fair use, or otherwise have valid legal rights for such use.

If you do not or did not have the necessary rights to the content used to mint an image through the Services, you may be liable not only to any person whose intellectual property or other proprietary rights you violated, but also to other users, including the owner of content that has been damaged through the minting of an image and subsequent use, in which you did not hold necessary rights. This could happen, for example, if we decide to disable or otherwise remove access from the Site to an image after receiving a valid Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) takedown notification without receiving a valid counter-notification. You agree to indemnify us for any claims asserted against us arising from you not having the necessary rights required to content posted on the Site or using the Services.

We will not, under any circumstances, be held liable to a user for removing allegedly infringing works from the Services or otherwise fulfilling our legal obligations under the DMCA.

We reserve the right to remove any image that violates these Terms, including, but not limited to, materials that infringe upon someone else's copyright, trademark, right of publicity, or that constitutes impersonation, unlawful conduct, harassment, or abuse.

If you believe any content on the Site violates your personal legal rights or these Terms, you can report content to us by clicking the “Report” button on the Site. We will review any content that is reported and immediately remove any content that violates these Terms.

We handle claims of copyright infringement in accordance with the DMCA. If you believe that any image available on or through the Services has been used in a way that violates your copyright, please report this by contacting: <legal@memester.xyz> 

Please be sure to include all information required by the DMCA. If you do not, we may ignore your takedown request and have no obligation to remove the allegedly infringing material. For more information, please see [17 U.S.C.§ 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512)

If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a user has attempted to upload content that infringes the intellectual property rights of another, we reserve the right to block the user’s digital wallet address. We also reserve the right to restrict a user’s access to and use of our Services for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, conduct that breaks our rules.

Site users expressly agree to cooperate and respond in a timely manner to our investigations, requests, and inquiries related to DMCA disputes or allegations of infringement. We will remove any images in response to a valid DMCA takedown notice or an allegation that the content reflected by the image is otherwise infringing a third party's intellectual property rights.

## 6. Modifications to the Services

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Services (or any part or content thereof) at any time and without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any modification, information change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.

## 7. Third-party Services, Links, Materials & Websites

The Site may include materials from third parties. Third-party links on this Site may direct you to third-party websites, applications, or resources that are not affiliated with us, including Lenster. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and we do not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties.

We are not liable for any harm or damages related to the order or use of goods, services, resources, content, or any other transactions made in connection with any third-party websites.

Agreement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith Negotiations

Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including an arbitration as set forth below, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or relating to the agreement or the Services (each, a “Dispute” and, collectively, “Disputes”) by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that the aggrieved party provide a written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the Dispute. The party receiving such notice shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or by telephone, to try to resolve the Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the parties may agree to mediate their Dispute, or either party may submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth below.

You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the procedures set forth above will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. The place of arbitration shall be Switzerland. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator(s) shall have experience adjudicating matters involving Internet technology, software applications, financial transactions and, ideally, blockchain technology.

FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

Changes

By rejecting any changes to these Terms, you agree that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and us in accordance with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
